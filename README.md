 # **Pewlett Hackard Analysis** 

## Overview of project: 

This project was intended to get us started using the Queries Language SQL. Our bosses at "Pewlett Hackard" wanted to their CSV Files of employees, department managers, etc. To be created into a SQL library for easy manipulation. Our bosses wanted to know who from Pewlett Hackard would be retiring and what their job title was. 

We gathered all the csv files and imported them into their correct SQL database tables so we could start to collect the number of employees who would be retiring. We wanted to know the following criteria: 

    1) Retirement titles and the names of the employees who hold those positions.

    2) When those employees started with the company and if they were still there.

    3) We needed those employees employee number.

    4) We needed how many employees in each title was retiring. 

    5) Lastly, we needed a Mentor Eligibility list of employees born between 01-01-1965 and 12-31-1965.


Below are small snippets of the tables to get an understanding what the final results were: 

### Retirment titles and names of employees who hold those positions

### How many retiring from each title

### Mentor Eligibility

## Summary:

As you can see from the table above, Pewlett Hackard is going to have their hands full with hiring new employees as a mass amount of people retire around the same time. Creating SQL tables allows us to take a very laborious task and simplify it. We can create new tables until we come to the conslussions we were searching for.
